# SuperStoreSalesAnalysis
I’ve developed a dynamic Tableau Dashboard using the Superstore Sales Dataset, focusing on visualizing key sales insights across various dimensions. Here’s a breakdown of the dashboard features:

🌍 Choropleth Map: Visualized sales data by state to analyze regional performance.<br>
💰 Donut Charts: Displayed total profit and total discount to easily assess overall business metrics.<br>
🛒 Pie Chart: Showcased sales distribution by category for specific years, offering a clear view of trends.<br>
📊 Histograms: Represented the distribution of profit and discount, helping to understand data variability.<br>
📈 Line Chart: Visualized the relationship between sales and profit over time.<br>
